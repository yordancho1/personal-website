                    <h3>Hello! I'm a passionate technologist and problem solver.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence at JKU Linz, I bring a unique blend of technical proficiency, 
                        creative thinking, and real-world business experience. With a strong foundation in web development, digital marketing, 
                        and client relationship management, I excel at translating complex problems into innovative solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey spans from system programming in high school to freelance web development, independent digital marketing consulting, 
                        and now diving deep into AI and computer science. I'm a fast learner who thrives on challenges and continuously 
                        adapts to emerging technologies. Beyond tech, I'm a professional ballroom and Latin dancer (B-Class Latin, A-Class Standard) 
                        and resident DJ at Zabranena Muzika, which has honed my discipline, creativity, and ability to perform under pressure.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">My Journey</h3>
                    <p>
                        I started my tech journey at the Professional High School of Electrical Engineering and Electronics "Apostol Arnaudov" 
                        in Ruse, Bulgaria (2016-2021), specializing in System Programming. This foundation in hardware-software interaction, 
                        operating systems, and low-level code implementation sparked my passion for understanding how technology works at its core. 
                        I completed practical projects in electrical circuit design and automated electronic systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From 2020 to 2024, I worked as an Independent Digital Marketing and Sales Consultant, developing and executing 
                        targeted digital marketing strategies across various online platforms. I managed all aspects of Client Relationship Management (CRM), 
                        utilized performance analytics and A/B testing to optimize content visibility, and consistently achieved high customer 
                        retention rates through personalized communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Summer 2025, I took on a freelance web development project where I demonstrated full ownership by designing, coding 
                        (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and independently deploying a professional corporate website. I managed the end-to-end process, 
                        including UI/UX design, front-end development, and setting up web hosting and domain services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since May 2023, I've been working as a Resident DJ and Entertainment Specialist at Zabranena Muzika, where I cultivate 
                        strong adaptability by "reading the audience" and curating musical programs that maximize guest engagement. I also briefly 
                        worked in Warehouse Logistics at ECONT Delivery Warehouse (12/2023-02/2024), where I managed inventory and collaborated 
                        in fast-paced team environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, as an AI student at Johannes Kepler University Linz (2024-Present), I'm combining all these experiences to focus on 
                        the future of technology. I previously attended the University of Ruse "Angel Kunchev" in 2021 but voluntarily withdrew 
                        to pursue opportunities aligned with the Artificial Intelligence field and gain practical business experience.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Beyond Technology</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding or studying AI, you'll find me on the dance floor or behind the DJ booth. As a professional 
                        ballroom and Latin dancer, I've achieved B-Class (Latin) and A-Class (Standard) in national competitions, learning 
                        the value of discipline, practice, and performing under high pressure. These skills translate directly to tech: 
                        attention to detail, pattern recognition, and the ability to stay calm when things go wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a resident DJ at Zabranena Muzika, I've learned to read the room, adapt on the fly, and create experiences that 
                        bring people together. I seamlessly blend diverse audio elements with technical precision, demonstrating high-level 
                        creativity while interacting with clients and venue staff. This experience has made me a better product thinker – 
                        understanding what people actually want versus what they say they want is crucial in both DJing and software development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm also passionate about competitive strategy gaming, which develops complex problem-solving and long-term planning 
                        skills, and electronic music production, which enhances my creative application of technical tools and audio editing abilities.
                    </p>
